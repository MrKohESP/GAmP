# GAmP
This circuit and subsequent project and headphone amplifier was designed and built for Mr. Koh's birthday.

# Happy Birthday Mr. Koh 2025

This GAmP is a discret transister class A headphone amplifier capabable of driving headphones from 16 ohms to 600 ohms.  While only tested on 16 and 300 ohms the differences in performance for any impedences above 90 ohms were all similar.
